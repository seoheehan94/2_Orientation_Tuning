# Orientation Tuning in humans
This study investigates how humans perceive orientation in complex images by comparing texture-based and contour-based computational methods. Through behavioural experiments and statistical modelling, I show that people rely more on shapes and edges than textures when judging orientation. Using neural data and an image-computable model, I demonstrate that contour-based orientation computations better align with human brain activity. These findings challenge filter-based models, highlighting the importance of edge-based processing in vision science.
